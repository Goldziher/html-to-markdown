This directory contains comprehensive feature guides with working code examples in multiple languages.

## Feature Guides

### Visitor Pattern
Customize HTML→Markdown conversion with callbacks for specific HTML elements. Use the visitor pattern for domain-specific dialects, content filtering, URL rewriting, and accessibility validation.

→ **[Full Guide with Examples](./visitor-pattern/)** - Python, TypeScript, Ruby code examples included

**Working Examples:**
- CDN URL rewriting
- Content filtering (remove ads, tracking)
- Accessibility validation (alt text, heading hierarchy)
- Async URL validation

### Metadata Extraction
Extract comprehensive metadata during conversion: document properties, headers, links, images, and structured data (JSON-LD, Microdata, RDFa).

→ **[Full Guide with Examples](./metadata-extraction/)** - Python, TypeScript, Ruby code examples included

**Working Examples:**
- SEO metadata extraction (title, description, Open Graph, Twitter Cards)
- Table of contents generation from headers
- Link validation and classification
- Accessibility audit (missing alt text, empty links)
- Content migration manifest

### Performance & Benchmarking
Understand performance characteristics across all language bindings, run benchmarks, profile memory usage, and optimize for your use case.

→ **[Full Guide with Examples](./performance/)** - Benchmarking tools and optimization guides

**Working Examples:**
- Benchmark fixtures (measure latency, throughput, memory)
- Memory profiling tools
- Streaming strategies for large files
