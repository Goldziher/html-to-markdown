  description: High-performance HTML to Markdown converter with a Rust core plus Python, TypeScript, and Ruby distribution packages.
  name: html-to-markdown
  version: 2.0.0
presets:
  - claude
  - gemini
rules:
  - content: Core conversion logic is in Rust. Python bindings expose the API via PyO3. Python code should be minimal wrappers around Rust functions. Rust code in crates/html-to-markdown/ implements the conversion engine using html5ever parser and ammonia sanitizer.
    name: Rust Core Architecture
    priority: critical
  - content: Use Python 3.10+ type hints for Python wrapper code. Rust code uses standard Rust types. Python type stubs in _rust.pyi provide type information for Rust bindings. Test both Python API and Rust implementation separately.
    name: Type Safety
    priority: critical
  - content: Python tests in packages/python/tests validate API and integration. Rust tests in crates/ validate core logic. TypeScript tests live in packages/typescript/tests and Ruby specs in packages/ruby/spec. Use pytest, vitest, rspec, and cargo test respectively. Maintain dual coverage with pytest-cov and cargo-llvm-cov.
    name: Dual Testing Strategy
    priority: critical
  - content: Use prek (not pre-commit) for pre-commit hooks. Format Python with ruff, Rust with cargo fmt. Lint Python with ruff, Rust with clippy. Run prek run --all-files to check everything. Install hooks with prek install && prek install --hook-type commit-msg.
    name: Code Quality with Prek
    priority: high
  - content: Use Taskfile for development tasks. Run task setup for initial setup, task update for dependency updates, task build for development builds, and task test:* for language-specific suites. See Taskfile.yaml for all available commands.
    name: Task Runner Commands
    priority: high
  - content: Build Python package with maturin via uv pip install -e packages/python. TypeScript package builds with pnpm run build in packages/typescript (after the Node bindings build), Ruby gem uses bundle exec rake spec/package in packages/ruby, and the CLI binary builds with cargo build --release --package html-to-markdown-cli.

      ## Prerequisites
      - Python 3.10+
      - Rust 1.75+ (stable)
      - uv package manager
      - Task (task runner)
      - prek (pre-commit hooks)

      ## Quick Setup
      ```bash
      # Clone and setup
      git clone https://github.com/Goldziher/html-to-markdown.git
      cd html-to-markdown
      task setup
      ```

      ## Running Tests
      ```bash
      # Python tests
      task test:python

      # Rust tests
      task test:rust

      # Both
      task test

      # With coverage
      task cov:all
      ```

      ## Development
      ```bash
      # Build Rust components
      task build

      # Format code
      task fmt

      # Run linters
      task lint

      # Run benchmarks
      task bench
      ```

      ## Rust Crates
      - **html-to-markdown**: Core conversion logic with html5ever + ammonia
      - **html-to-markdown-node**: Native Node.js bindings (NAPI-RS)
      - **html-to-markdown-wasm**: WebAssembly bindings
      - **html-to-markdown-py**: PyO3 bindings consumed by Python package
      - **html-to-markdown-cli**: Standalone CLI binary

      ## Distribution Packages
      - **packages/python**: PyPI package with Python API and tests
      - **packages/typescript**: npm package + CLI built on Node bindings
      - **packages/ruby**: Ruby gem using Magnus bindings
    name: Architecture Overview
    priority: medium

      ## CI Workflows
      - **ci.yaml**: Main CI running Rust, Python, Ruby, Node, TypeScript, and WASM tests plus linting/formatting
      - **test-wheels.yaml**: Build and test Python wheels across platforms

      ## Coverage
      - Rust: cargo-llvm-cov generates rust-coverage.lcov
      - Python: pytest-cov generates coverage.lcov
      - Upload artifacts from CI when needed

      ## Testing Matrix
      - Python: 3.10, 3.12, 3.14-dev
      - OS: Linux, macOS, Windows
      - Rust tests run on all platforms; TypeScript and Ruby test on Unix + Windows where supported

      ## Prek Configuration
      - .prek-config.yaml contains hook configuration
      - Hooks run ruff, clippy, cargo fmt, mypy
      - Install with prek install (not pre-commit install)
